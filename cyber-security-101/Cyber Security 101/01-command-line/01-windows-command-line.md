### Introduction

Advantages of using a CLI (command line interface):
- lower resource usage: require fewer system resources then GUI's that are more graphic intensive
- Automation: done with ease by creating a batch file or a script to run a task
- Remote management: manage a remote system using SSH 

### Basic System Information

`set` - shows a list of all environment variables on the system
`ver` - displays the current version of the running operating system
`systeminfo` - displays detailed info such as hardware, operating system, and network details

### Network Troubleshooting

the command line provides many networking related commands:
`ipconfig` - displays networking information about the machine
`ipconfig /all` - provides more in-depth info of the network
`ping target_name` - tests the connectivity between the machine and another device 
`tracert target_name` - traces the network route traversed to reach target 
`nslookup` - looks up the hostname and returns its IP address
`netstat` - displays current network connections and listening ports 
`netstat -abon` - combining flags to show a larger info set for network connections
